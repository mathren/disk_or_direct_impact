 simulations (albeit still state-of-the-art), and severe
 approximations that we can improve on.

** Simple explanation

   When mass transfer starts in a stellar binary, matter flows through
   the first Lagrangian point L1 in between the stars. This repo
   visualizes when this stream "misses" the accretor and circularizes in
   a disk around it, or when instead the stream hits directly the
   accretor.

   The script =/src/disk_vs_accretion.py= visualizes the fit
   from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976ApJ...206..509U/abstract][Ulrich & Burger 1976]] to the numerical simulations of
   [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...198..383L/abstract][Lubow & Shu 1975]] of the distance of minimum approach of the
   stream R_{min}. We use a simple mass radius relation to model the
   accretor radius R_{2}, and assume a disk is formed only if R_{min} > R_{2},
   else the stream impacts directly the accreting star.

** Figures

   These were used in this joint talk ([[https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~mrenzo/materials/slides/Renzo_Farmer_open_prob_bin.pdf][slides]]) with [[https://github.com/rjfarmer][rjfarmer]] at the
   KITP workshop "Bridging the Gap: Accretion and Orbital Evolution in
   Stellar and Black Hole Binaries" in 2022. *N.B.:* those figures where
   affected by a bug found by [[https://github.com/ruggero-valli][R. Valli]], which resulted in
   overestimating the range for direct accretion. This has now been
   fixed.


*** 35M_{\odot} donor star
    Parameter space for direct impact vs. disk formation for a 35M_{\odot}
    donor as a function of ZAMS mass ratio and separation.

    Disks form only with large separations and mass ratios even when
    neglecting the evolution of the secondary, which usually is
    assumed to lead to common envelope:

*** Varying donor star mass

   Same as above, but with varying donor masses as labeled. As the
   donor mass increases the parameter space for disk formation shrinks:
