#+Title: Disk or direct impact?
#+author: Mathieu Renzo

 When mass transfer starts in a stellar binary, matter flows through
 the first Lagrangian point L1 in between the stars. This repo
 visualizes when this stream "misses" the accretor and circularizes in
 a disk around it, or when instead the stream hits directly the
 accretor.

 The folder =/src/= contains in ipython notebook to visualize the fit
 from [][Ulrich & Burger 1976] to the numerical simulations of
 [][Lubow & Shu 1975] of the distance of minimum approach of the
 stream R_{min. We use a simple mass radius relation to model the
 accretor radius R_{2}, and assume a disk is formed only if

   Parameter space for direct impact vs. disk formation for a 35M_{\odot}
   donor as a function of ZAMS mass ratio and separation.

   Disks form only with large separations and mass ratios even when
   neglecting the evolution of the secondary, which usually is
   assumed to lead to common envelope:

  Same as above, but with varying donor masses as labeled. As the
  donor mass increases the parameter space for disk formation shrinks:
